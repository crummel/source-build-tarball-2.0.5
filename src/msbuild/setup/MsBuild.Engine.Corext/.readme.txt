This package includes the files that MSBuild ships into Visual Studio via its .vsix.
Paths are adjusted to match the corext package MsBuild.Corext.

Files in the MSBuild vsix which are not in this package:
- msbuild satellite assemblies (no translation needed for corext)
- MSBuild.exe.config (MsBuild.Corext has manual edits to this file)
- *pkgdef (VS specific)
