# Microsoft.Build (MSBuild)
The Microsoft Build Engine is a platform for building applications. This engine, which is also known as MSBuild, provides an XML schema for a project file that controls how the build platform processes and builds software. Visual Studio uses MSBuild, but MSBuild *does not* depend on Visual Studio. By invoking msbuild.exe on your project or solution file, you can orchestrate and build products in environments where Visual Studio isn't installed.

For more information on MSBuild, see the [MSBuild documentation](https://docs.microsoft.com/visualstudio/msbuild/msbuild) on docs.microsoft.com.

### Build Status

The current development branch is `master`. It builds for .NET Core and the full desktop .NET framework. Changes in `master` will go into the next "major" update of MSBuild.

### Source code

* Clone the sources: `git clone https://github.com/Microsoft/msbuild.git`

## Building
### Building MSBuild with Visual Studio 2017
For the full supported experience, you will need to have Visual Studio 2017.

To get started on **Visual Studio 2017**:

1. [Install Visual Studio 2017](https://www.visualstudio.com/vs/).  Select the following Workloads:
  - _.NET desktop development_
  - _Desktop development with C++_
    - Optional, build warnings may occur without it.
  - _.NET Core cross-platform development_
    - Optional, not strictly required (yet) but used to develop .NET Core applications.
2. Clone the source code (see above).
3. Build the code using the `cibuild.cmd` script.
5. Open src/MSBuild.sln solution in Visual Studio 2017.

### Building MSBuild in Unix (Mac & Linux)
MSBuild can be run on Unix systems that support .NET Core. Set-up instructions can be viewed on the wiki:   [Building Testing and Debugging on .Net Core MSBuild](https://github.com/Microsoft/msbuild/wiki/Building-Testing-and-Debugging-on-.Net-Core-MSBuild)

## Localization
You can turn on localized builds via the `/p:LocalizedBuild=true` command line argument. For more information on localized builds and how to make contributions to MSBuild's translations, see our [localization wiki](https://github.com/Microsoft/msbuild/wiki/Localization)

### MSBuild Components

* **MSBuild**. [Microsoft.Build.CommandLine](https://docs.microsoft.com/visualstudio/msbuild/msbuild)  is the entrypoint for the Microsoft Build Engine (MSBuild.exe).

* **Microsoft.Build**. The [Microsoft.Build](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/gg145008.aspx) namespaces contain types that provide programmatic access to, and control of, the MSBuild engine.

* **Microsoft.Build.Framework**. The [Microsoft.Build.Framework](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/microsoft.build.framework.aspx) namespace contains the types that define how tasks and loggers interact with the MSBuild engine. For additional information on this component, see our [Microsoft.Build.Framework wiki page](https://github.com/Microsoft/msbuild/wiki/Microsoft.Build.Framework).

* **Microsoft.Build.Tasks**. The [Microsoft.Build.Tasks](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/microsoft.build.tasks.aspx) namespace contains the implementation of all tasks shipping with MSBuild.

* **Microsoft.Build.Utilities**. The [Microsoft.Build.Utilities](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/microsoft.build.utilities.aspx) namespace provides helper classes that you can use to create your own MSBuild loggers and tasks.
