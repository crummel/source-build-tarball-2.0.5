  <!-- Override the GetReferenceAssemblyPaths target from Microsoft.Common.CurrentVersion.targets, since there is no reference assembly folder
       when targeting .NET Core, and that target otherwise will generate an error saying reference assemblies couldn't be found.  This is in
       an entirely separate targets file so that it can be conditionally imported and the target will only be overridden when building for
       .NET Core -->
