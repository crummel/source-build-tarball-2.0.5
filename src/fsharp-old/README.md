# The F# Language, Library Repository (also Visual F# Tools Repository)

You are invited to help producing future releases of the F# language compiler, library, and tools. This repository enables development on Linux, macOS and Windows, along with some automated CI testing for these.

* [About F#](http://fsharp.org)
* [Testimonials](http://fsharp.org/testimonials)
* [Contributing](#contributing)
* [Using](#using)

The F# Compiler and Tools are also mirrored in [the corresponding repository](http://github.com/fsharp/fsharp) of the F# Software Foundation.

Changes contributed here are eventually propagated to this repository and are included in all packagings of F# and open source F# editing tools. The process for doing this is explained in this guide by the [F# Core Engineering Group](https://fsharp.github.io/2014/06/18/fsharp-contributions.html). Currently, the F# community coordinates packaging [other editions of F#](https://github.com/fsharp/fsharp/) for use on Linux, macOS, Android, iOS, and other platforms, and Microsoft coordinates packaging this repository as part of the Visual F# Tools. 

For historical reasons this repository is called "visualfsharp" and currently also contains the Visual F# IDE Tools. The eventual plan is to split these repositories into "fsharp" and "visualfsharp".

## Using

For typical installs of  F#, see http://fsharp.org.

### Using Nightly Releases of Visual F# Tools

To setup Visual Studio to use the latest nightly releases of the Visual F# Tools, follow the [Using CI Builds](https://github.com/Microsoft/visualfsharp/wiki/Using-CI-Builds) instructions.

### Using CI Builds

To install F#, see http://fsharp.org.

To download the bits for the latest CI builds see [these instructions](https://github.com/Microsoft/visualfsharp/wiki/Using-CI-Builds). This includes and ZIPs containing the F# compiler and VSIX installers for the Visual F# IDE Tools.

### Using F# on a build server or computer without an F# installation

If you wish to use the latest F# compiler on a computer without Visual Studio 2017 installed, you can add the nuget package ``FSharp.Compiler.Tools`` to your projects. This will replace the in-box compiler with the version contained in the package.
The actual package is built in https://github.com/fsharp/fsharp.

You will need to adjust the targets reference on your project file to use the targets file from the installed ``FSharp.Compiler.Tools`` package.
See https://github.com/fsharp/fsharp/issues/676 for how to modify your project file.
